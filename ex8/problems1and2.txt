(a) PCA and SOM can be used to represent high-dimensional data on a 2D plane. PCA is 
linear method, i.e., it finds a projection of the data on a plane such that the 
information of the projected data is maximized. SOM is a nonlinear projection method.
It project data on two dimensional array of prototype vectors such that the neighborhood
relations are retained. MDS is computed based on the pair-wise distance matrix of the data.
It finds a two dimensional representation of the data based on the distance matrix.

(b) A collection of interesting bioinformatics visualization can be found in [1]. Figure 7
shows a high resolution segmentation of ENCODE data by SOM. The SOM was trained using the 
signal of the 12 different ChIP-seq and DNase-seq assays in the six cell types analysed
in the paper.

2.

(a) Mahalanobis distance equals euclidean distance on standardized and decorrelated data.

(b) Probability density based clustering methods model the data as a sum of probability 
distributions (e.g., Gaussian mixture model). The resulting model can be intepreted as
a clustering for the data. 

(c) From the choices presented, we would use (i) to for bicluster of gene expression 
data of prostate cancer patients. This is reasonable, since genes are known to be
coregulated only in certain conditions.
